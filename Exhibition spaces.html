                    sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.</h2>
                <h2 class="Cosmology_content_midscreens1">We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can
                    be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the
                    stars to travel by.</h2>
                <h2 class="Cosmology_content_midscreens1">Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
                    traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to
                    the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</h2>

                <h2>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do
                    we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
                    framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</h2>
                <h2 class="Evolution_content_midscreens1">Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the
                    species we know today have evolved our time.
                    You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
                    Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</h2>

                <h2 class="Biology_and_medicine_content_midscreens1">For many people their life expectancy is much
                    longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks
                    to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
                    medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the
                    first heart transplant.</h2>
                <h2 class="Biology_and_medicine_content_midscreens1">Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come
                    not only from the lab, but also from observing
                    animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</h2>

                    whole planet.</h2>

                    currently face including global
                    warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
