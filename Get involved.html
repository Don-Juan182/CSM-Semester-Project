                <h1>Get Involved</h1>
                <h2>Support</h2>
                <h3>There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very welcome and are an important
                    way we keep this museum open and accessible to the whole community.</h3>
                <h3>You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. If you have some
                    item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our
                    Collections Department and they will be able to assist you.</h3>
                <h2>Volunteer</h2>
                <h3>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for
                    visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of
                    a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers
                    come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.</h3>
                <h3>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out
                    more about how you can get involved.</h3>
                <h2>Internships</h2>
                <h3>Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement of sharing the
                    wonders of nature with people? Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at the
                    museum.</h3>
                <div class="last_h3_content">

                        and sharing it with the wider community.</h3>
